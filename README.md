# Solutions to Competitve Programming problems
This repo contains my personal solutions to a variety of competitive programming problems. These solutions are by no means necessarily optimal, and my code will not necessarily be elegant, pretty and maintainable, since the code in the repo is *"run once"* code. 

My code in this repo has been produced over a long time period, which means I have learnt new things along the way about programming, so don't be confused if my coding style or amount of functional-style solutions change wildly between one problem to another.

I hope you will enjoy this repo and learn something new!

## Languages
I use my favorite languages (and Python) for competitive programming. Here the languages used in this repo (in no particular order):
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)

## Platforms
These are the platforms I use and have used in the repo
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## But why?
Why did I create this repo? My hope is that my solutions can help or inspire others who enjoy competitive programming to learn new things about effecient algorithmic solutions, or specific language features. 

I, for one, have been stuck on *efficient IO in Python* and *mutability in Haskell* before for example. And a repo like this would definitely have saved me some time.
